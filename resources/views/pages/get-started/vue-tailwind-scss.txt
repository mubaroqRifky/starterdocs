vue-tailwind-scss

Get started create a project SPA with Vue.js
npm init vue@latest
For Vue.js 3 it has built on Vite module builder instead webpack.

Vue Router
if you forgot add vue router when you create with code as we mention above then you can install separately.
npm i vue-router

Tailwindcss in your project
If you want to add css framework such as tailwindcss that makes you easier for styling then you have do something command as we mention in below.
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

Sass Pre-Processors
We can add sass preprocessor like sass or stylus, all you need to do is execute command below and then you have add your main sass file into your main javascript project.
npm install -D sass

Integrated with Axios
With Axios you can make your fetching data to the server easier and you can add into your project with code below.
npm i axios

State Management
In vue we know a state that can be put into a tag or we can remove or add an element within that state and to make us easier to transfer the data to any elements or component it is going to be tricky.
So we can add a package that will manage our state, it is called Vuex.

Implementing Code
To implements all the package that we are going to use, you have to add them into a plugins folder and import it to the main.js.

Project file Structure is going to be like this :
mkdir -p src/{assets/{css,scss,images,icons},components,views/{auth,errors,layouts,pages},router,store/states,plugins}
touch src/router/{index,routes}.js
touch src/store/{index,state,getters,actions,mutations}.js
touch src/assets/{css/main.css,scss/main.scss}
